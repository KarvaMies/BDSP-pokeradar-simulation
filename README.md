# Pokéradar simulation for the games Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Pokémon Shining Pearl

Code updated and conversed from this reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonBDSP/comments/r5ngul/pokéradar_shiny_chaining_optimal_chain_length_is/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

How to use:

1. Run the program

   1.5. Choose whether you want to simulate hunt or analyze existing data

2. Type how many shinies you plan to hunt
3. Wait for the data to be simulated
4. You have can visualize the data into line charts, delete saved images or data

Simulation for catching more than 4 shinies is not recommended and will propably take up to an hour depending you hardware if SAMPLE_SIZE is not modified. However, when lowering SAMPLE_SIZE, the simulation becomes less accurate.
